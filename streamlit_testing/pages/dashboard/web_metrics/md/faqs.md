#### How often is data in the dashboard updated?
Data in the dashboard is updated automatically three times a day. This happens roughly a. before work hours, b. late morning and c. mid-afternoon, although the exact time varies a little each day. Data for the last 48 hours is provisional, and is refined with each update.

#### Can data in the dashboard change?
Yes. Web traffic numbers and download numbers can be revised upwards in the first 48 hours as Google Analytics (the tool we use to track web metrics) takes 24&ndash;48 hours to fully process web traffic.

Content metadata - for example which team owns a page, or the last update date for an explainer - can also change where it is changed on the website or more accurate data becomes available to the dashboard.

#### How accurate is the data?
Web metrics data presented in the dashboard is reasonably accurate, though there are two mains factors that mean things are less than 100% accurate:
- **Downloads data excludes direct access to files** 'Downloads' counts all instances where someone clicks a download link or a call-to-action button within the IfG website to download a file. It does not include instances where someone goes directly to an publication by following a link that has been shared with them - it is not possible to measure these instances.
- **Cookie consent and privacy settings** Where website visitors reject analytics cookies, Google Analytics estimates the usage of users who reject cookies based on the behaviour of similar users who accept them.

There are also two specific period for which accurate data isn't available - see below.

#### Why is accurate data not available for some periods?
We don't have accurate data for two periods, as shown in the line charts. For a period in late 2023, a problem recording web traffic statistics means we do not have accurate data. For a second period in late 2024/early 2025, a change in how Google processed web traffic means we do not have accurate data.

#### Is internal traffic included in web metrics?
Internal traffic is mostly excluded. Traffic from office IP addresses is identified as being internal traffic though in some cases traffic may not be caught by these rules, and traffic from staff that is not from an IfG IP addresses (e.g. when accessing the site from home or on a mobile not connected to the office WiFi network) is included in the figures presented in the dashboard.

#### What does a content type of 'Other' mean?
This consists of standalone data visualisations, people pages, press releases and 'IfG in the news' pages.

#### What does 'Unclassified' mean (in the content type, publication type or team colums)?
These are pages and outputs for which content metadata isn't available. This is generally where a page or publication hasn't been accessed recently, the relevant field in the website CMS is empty (in the case of the 'team' column), or where someone has entered an invalid web address.

For pages which haven't been accessed recently, in most cases a content type has been imputed but in some cases this is not possible. It is not possible to impute publication types.
