## Can data in the dashboard change?

Yes. Web traffic numbers and download numbers can be revised upwards in the first 48 hours as Google Analytics (the tool we use to track web metrics) takes 24&ndash;48 hours to fully process web traffic.

Content metadata - for example which team owns a page, or the last update date for an explainer - can also change where it is changed on the website or more accurate data becomes available to the dashboard.

## What does a content type of 'Other' mean?
This consists of standalone data visualisations, people pages, press releases and 'IfG in the news' pages.

## What does 'Unclassified' mean (in the content type, publication type or team colums)?
These are pages and outputs for which content metadata isn't available. This is generally where a page or output hasn't been accessed recently, the relevant field in the website CMS is empty (in the case of the 'team' column), or where someone has entered an invalid web address.

For pages which haven't been accessed recently, in most cases a content type has been imputed but in some cases this is not possible. It is not possible to impute publication types.

## What does 'Downloads' measure?
'Downloads' counts all instances where someone clicks a download link or a call-to-action button within the IfG website to download a file.

It does not include instances where someone goes directly to an output by following a link that has been shared with them - it is not possible to measure these instances.
