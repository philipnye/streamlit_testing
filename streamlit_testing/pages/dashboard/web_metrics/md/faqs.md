## Can data in the dashboard change?

Yes. Web traffic numbers and download numbers can be revised upwards in the first 48 hours as Google Analytics (the tool we use to track web metrics) takes 24&ndash;48 hours to fully process web traffic.

Content metadata - for example which team owns a page, or the last update date for an explainer - can also change where it is changed on the website or more accurate data becomes available to the dashboard.

## What does a content type of 'Other/unclassified' mean?
This group consists of pages where either:
- Content doesn't fall into one of the other content type categories (this is true of things like standalone data visualisations, people pages, press releases and 'IfG in the news' pages); or
- Content metadata isn't available for the page.

The latter group consists of pages which haven't been accessed since the dashboard was developed, and incorrect web addresses that someone has used. For pages which haven't been accessed since the dashboard was developed, in most cases a content type has been imputed but in some cases this is not possible.

## What does a publication type of 'Unclassified' mean?
This group consists of pages which haven't been accessed since the dashboard was developed, and incorrect web addresses that someone has used. For pages which haven't been accessed since the dashboard was developed it is not possible to impute a publication type.

## What does 'Downloads' measure?
'Downloads' counts all instances where someone clicks a download link or a call-to-action button within the IfG website to download a file.

It does not include instances where someone goes directly to an output by following a link that has been shared with them - it is not possible to measure these instances.
