### Can data in the dashboard change?

Yes. Web traffic numbers and download numbers can be revised upwards in the first 48 hours as Google Analytics (the tool we use to track web metrics) takes 24&ndash;48 hours to fully process web traffic.

Content metadata - for example which team owns a page, or the last update date for an explainer - can also change where it is changed on the website or more accurate data becomes available to the dashboard.
